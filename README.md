# chatbot
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to assist users by answering customer support queries based only on the provided documentation.  If the chatbot cannot find a relevant answer within the available knowledge base, it responds with  "I Don't know" ensuring accuracy and avoiding hallucinated (made-up) responses.
