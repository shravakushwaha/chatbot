# ü§ñ Customer Support Chatbot (RAG-based)

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot built with **FastAPI** and a simple **HTML/CSS** frontend.  
It assists users by answering queries based only on provided customer support documents.

If no relevant information is found, it replies:

> **"I Don't know"**

ensuring factual and reliable support.
